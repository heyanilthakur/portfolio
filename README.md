# Project Credit

This project is built upon the inspiring work of [Brittany Chiang](https://github.com/bchiang7). The design and structure of this project's portfolio website draw inspiration from Brittany Chiang's GitHub repository. I would like to extend my gratitude for providing such a fantastic template that allowed me to create this portfolio. You can find the original repository [here](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4).

Thank you, Brittany Chiang, for your open-source contribution and for empowering developers to showcase their skills and experiences in a visually appealing way! ðŸ™Œ
